### 5.3 In practice

In practice we do not know Σ nor µ = E(Xi) and instead we use their empirical counterparts ¯X and S, i.e.:


Yi1 = gT
(Xi − ¯X )
1


Yik = gT
(Xi − ¯X )
k

note, x1 and x bar are vectors
In what follows I will not always use empirical notations as that can quickly become too heavy but IN PRACTICE WE ALWAYS USE EMPIRICAL VERSIONS. 

```{admonition} Example: Swiss bank notes data
X1: Length of bill (mm)
X2: Width of left edge (mm)
X3: Width of right edge (mm)
X4: Bottom margin width (mm)
X5: Top margin width (mm)
X6: Length of diagonal (mm
```
