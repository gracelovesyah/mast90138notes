## Lab
Your task today will be to apply the linear and logistic classifiers to these data:

(1) use the training data to construct the classifier;

(2) apply the classifier to the test data;

(3) draw the decision boundary on a scatterplot of the training X data, where each X is coloured according to their true group.

(4) draw the decision boundary on a scatterplot of the test X data, where each X is coloured according to their true group. Use also a different symbol according to the group where they are classified so that we can see which are correctly classified.

(5) Compute the classification error of the classifier on those test data
